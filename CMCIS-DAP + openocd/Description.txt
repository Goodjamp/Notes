			 The general architecture of VSCode download/debug


VSCode launch.json -> arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe -> openocd -> CMSIC-DAP
                                        

For flashing  and debug MCU we need the SW above:
- VSCode
- arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe
- openocd
+ CMSIC-DAP programer

VSCode 
VSCode is a free IDE. It could use a CMakeLists file as a project file.
For download/debugging:                           
- send command (like a flash, erase, read, step)          
  to the openocd according to the UI controls
- display result commands processing on UI

arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe
arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe is a free gdb client shared with the Arm GNU Toolchain.
The main goal of this SW: send debug commands (e.g., breakpoints, stepping, memory inspection) to OpenOCD via the GDB Remote Serial Protocol (RSP) and
displays information like register values, stack frames, and disassembly to the developer.
The arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe connects to OpenOCD over a TCP/IP socket (the GDB interface's default port is 3333).

OpenOCD
OpenOCD is a free SW gdb server. It is a bridge between the gdb
client (for example arm-none-eabi-gdb) and programmer (CMSIC-DAP, JLink, StLink, and so on).

CMSIC-DAP
CMSIC-DAP i—Ñ a free FW project to download and debug FW
