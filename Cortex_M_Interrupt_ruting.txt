Cortex-M3 has 2 stack pointers:
- main stack pointer MSP
- proces stack pointer PSP

When an exception or interruption happens the core:
- the core automatically copies a list of registers to the current stack (MSP or PSP).
  The name of the register list is *Stack Frame*. R0-R3, R12, LR, 
  The operation of copy registers to the stack is called Stacking.

At a minimum, an exception stack frame must contain at least eight words, as shown in the diagram above. These eight words of data contain the caller-saved registers
in the regular register bank and information to enable the pre-empted software to resume. Because exception handlers can be implemented as normal C functions, the contents
of R0-R3, R12, LR, and RETPSR must be saved. Unlike function calls, the return address for exception handlers is not stored in the LR.

- If interrupt routine need to use all other register, the C function must push and pop all needed register obviously
