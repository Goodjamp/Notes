RTP timing. Key feature
Key Points:
time_base:

Set as {1, 90000} for RTP with H.264.
Ensures timestamps align with the RTP clock.
framerate:

Configured as {30, 1} for 30 FPS.
pts and dts:

Calculated as i * (time_base.denominator / framerate.num) for each frame.
Packetization:

FFmpeg handles the H.264 packetization for RTP automatically, splitting the encoded frame into RTP packets.
SDP File:

If needed, generate an SDP file with av_sdp_create and save it for client playback configuration.
This setup streams H.264-encoded frames over RTP with timestamps calculated for 30 FPS.
